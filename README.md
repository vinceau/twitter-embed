# Twitter Embed

Inspired by [this blog post](https://compsci.rocks/embed-twitter-timeline-without-javascript/).

Simple SPA which holds a Twitter embed. This allows you to use iframes to embed a Twitter timeline without executing any additional Javascript.

This is useful for situations where you don't trust the execution environment of the remote Twitter scripts, such as in an Electron app.
